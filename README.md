## Implementation

### Core Requirements

- [ ] Authentication and Authorization

### How i will implement this

The bookstore will be comprised of three services

- Reviews service to manage reviews and raitings for a book
- Sales service to manage prices and sales of a book

All of these will be behind a RESTful API which will handle requests.
